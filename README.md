## Data Architecture

The current version as of 8/11/2019 contains a SQLite database named `WashEx-db.sqlite`, which contains all of the data scraped and processed from the Washington State Legislature's [legislative services API](wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov) that is implemented in the project. Below is a description of the contents and architecture of the database.

* Sponsors: contains identifying and demographic information on individual legislators
* Committees: contains information on legislative commitees and their active status
* Actions: contains information on legislative actions carried out on bills throughout their lifetime
* Sessions: contains information on start and end dates for legislative sessions in each congress
